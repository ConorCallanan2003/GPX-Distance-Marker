## Add Distance Markers to GPX
This is a tiny script I wrote in about ten minutes when I needed to add waypoints to mark each kilometer in a GPX file as I couldn't find anything online that would do it. It served its purpose well.

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone this repo (or download the one file it contains)
2. Run 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Replace the paths of the input and output files in the script
4. Run 
```bash
python main.py
```

**Enjoy!**
